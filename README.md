# Welcome to my Portfolio!

## About Me
Hello! My name is Taylor Byrne and I am a Computer Science (BSc) graduate who studied at Edge Hill University, with an interest in software development and software testing. I put my free time into my volunteer developer position that I have at BlockWars (Capollo Media), a popular Minecraft live event that countless content creators take part in. I utilise Kotlin while working on BlockWars, as well as custom in-house tools and APIs. I currently also do voluntary software testing work for Noxcrew, which is a company that creates professional content in the video game, Minecraft. I am also consistently pushing myself and learning about how to create fun, custom coded content within Minecraft. I have a great passion for coding and all the possibilities you can create with it. I have mostly written code in Java, Kotlin and Python. Various university and school projects, including my dissertation were written in Python. I also have experience using Git, GitHub and GitLab version control.
