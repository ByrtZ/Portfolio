## About Me
I am currently a second year university student studying a Computer Science BSc degree, with a keen interest in software development and software testing. I currently do voluntary software testing work for Noxcrew, which is a company that creates professional content in the video game, Minecraft. I am also consistently pushing myself and learning about how to create content within the video game Minecraft, using code. I have mostly written code in the languages Java and Kotlin, along with various smaller university and school projects which were written in Python.
